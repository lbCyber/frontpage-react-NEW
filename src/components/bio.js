        <h5>Hey there!</h5>
        <p>I'm a multi-skilled front-end developer and writer based in Toronto, Canada.</p>
        <p>I'm always refining my skills as a creator and as both a front-end and back-end developer. Below you can see just a small glimpse of the work I've done as a front-end developer, applying my past skills in print design, graphic design, animation,
            writing, and photography!</p>
        <h5 className="mobileExclude">What's your story?</h5>
        <p className="mobileExclude">Born and raised in Niagara Falls, I eventually found myself in love with the city of Toronto, studying at prestigious schools including <a href="http://utoronto.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Toronto</a>, <a href="http://humber.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humber College</a>,
            and <a href="https://junocollege.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juno</a> (formerly <a href="https://hackeryou.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackerYou</a>).</p>
        <p>I have years of experience freelancing as a web developer for small businesses and non-profits, as well as a copy editor and writer, trading largely with local publications.</p>
        <h5 className="mobileExclude">Okay, but what else?</h5>
        <p>Having graduated from Juno's immersive front-end development program, I have become a highly-skilled and dedicated front-end developer, with a deeply-rooted love for what I do.</p>
        <p>I have an indomitable passion for giving back to the LGBTQ+ community, of which I owe so much, and love working with people and working toward making the world a better place through both charity foundations and advocacy.</p>
        <p>Most of all, I am dedicated to growing as a person and becoming better every day, however I can. I have a genuine love of all people and will always go out of my way to provide whatever support I can for those in need.
          </p>
        <h6 className="ds">(Also I'm pretty good at Dark Souls)</h6>
