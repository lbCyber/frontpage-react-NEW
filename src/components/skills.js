          <p className="mobileExclude">I consider myself a life-long creator and a veteran in web development (though one who is constantly learning and improving). </p>
          <p>My philosophy in design has always been to challenge myself and invent new and ambitious ways of developing content. In web development in particular, I pride myself in avoiding prefabs and third-party libraries in my own personal work; if it's
            something I can learn to do myself, that's what I'm going to do.</p>
          <p>That isn't to say I don't have experience with libraries, though! I often work with the more essential Javascript libraries, including jQuery and React.js</p>
          <h5 className="mobileExclude">I am a programmer</h5>
          <p>My experience as a programmer began at an early age, when I would explore the inner workings of DOS and write small games using chains of batch scripts.</p>
          <p>Since then, I have expanded on and improved my skills and abilities on my own as a self-taught coder with experience in languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, and C.</p>
          <h5 className="mobileExclude">I am an artist</h5>
          <p>On the design side of web development, as the son of an art teacher, I had always possessed a certain ability for visual arts and layout. Throughout my life I have constantly worked to improve my aptitude in digital graphics and animation, as well as my instincts in colours and form. With a formal education in print design and layout, I've used my collection of abilities to always come up with new and interesting ways of developing exciting web sites and applications.</p>
