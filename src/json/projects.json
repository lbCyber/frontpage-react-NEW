      "text": "<p>The Haiku generator was one of the larger-scale web applications I've created, and one of my prouder accomplishments.</p>\n<p>Programmed entirely in Javascript, this project was a labour of love and my final piece for <a href=\"https://junocollege.com\" target=\"_blank\">Juno</a>'s part-time web development program. The intent was to create a procedural method of producing genuine, randomly-generated haikus faithful to the traditional Japanese style. Every line is chosen from a database of personally-written poetry, along with an accompanying, low-weight looping background animation.</p>\n<p>The project took about a week to design and build, with additional time spent to refine and add to the overall product after completion.</p>\n<p>There were a lot of issues in its development, including caching issues that force the unloading of webm assets, but that only emboldened me to work harder and learn more.</p>\n<p>I'm now working on importing the app into React.</p>",

      "text": "<p>Scope Creep has been my most ambitious project to date, and a piece I'm constantly working on and improving. It currently exists a proof-of-concept story-telling framework running a work-in-progress story.</p>\n<p>Built in Javascript, this served as my entry into developing an API for my purposes, designed with future expandability in mind. This API permits the developer to produce their own story with a simple and easy-to-understand interface, though with a powerful choice-based system.</p>\n<p>It was a lot of fun to make, and offered me a chance to try out new ideas for styling effects in CSS, including scanlines, image artifacting, and pixelation. The 'Options' button provides the user with their choice of traditional computer terminals for the styles to emulate, including a plaintext option as an accessibility feature.</p>",

      "text": "<p>Foot-Forward is another PSD conversion site I found interesting and fulfilling to work on.</p>\n<p>The reason is, specifically, because of the limitations imposed in the exercise: Objects <em>must</em> be aligned using only floats. That meant taking a careful approach to ensure that collisions between objects wouldn't happen. With the additional factor of making the site fully responsive, this conversion was a lot of work to pull off, despite the very simple aesthetic.</p>\n<p>Ultimately the work I've found most rewarding are those not necessarily the most aesthetically-rich, but that provide the greatest learning experience.</p>",
